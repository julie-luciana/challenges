/**Task: Create an Image component to render <img> tags.

💡 This will be a helper component to create a Logo and Avatar component.

The Image component returns an <img> element with className="round-image" and
receives the props src and alt and passes them to the src and alt attributes.
as we don't need children here, this component should not have a children prop */

export default function Image({ src, alt }) {
  return <img className="round-image" src={src} alt={alt} />;
}
