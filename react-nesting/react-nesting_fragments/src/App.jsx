/**

Task: Outsource the three `Box` components to a 
`Boxes` component.

- In the `App.jsx` file, create a `Boxes` 
component which
  - returns the same three `Box` components as given above.
  - For now, use a `<div>` component as a wrapper in the return 
  statement of the `Boxes` component.
- In the `App` component, replace the three `Box` components 
with the `Boxes` component.

Check the browser: the boxes are now vertically aligned! ðŸ˜±

The reason is this: a flexbox refers only to its direct child 
elements; however, using a `<div>` element in `Boxes` creates a 
new layer so that the three `Box` elements are no longer flex items!

Use the developer tools of your browser to check this fact.

To fix this, replace the `<div>` with fragments `<></>`: they 
won't create an HTML element and thus break the layout!

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you have seen the basic reason why and how to use React fragments! */
